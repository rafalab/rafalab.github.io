### Bioconductor

Software is an effective way to disseminate statistical methodology. I try to develop R packages for the statistical ideas I publish. 
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) is an open source and open development
software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic
data. Because genomics is the focus of most of my work, the majority
of my software is availalbe through Bioconductor and you can find
these software packages by visiting the projects
[portal](http://www.bioconductor.org) where you will find packages for pretty
much any genomics data analysis need. Examples of some of the
packages my lab has contributed to are: 

- _alpine_: modeling systematic bias to improve quantification from RNA-Seq 
- _CQN_: removing GC-content bias from expression level RNA-Seq data
- _rnaseqcomp_: implementation of benchmarks for RNA-seq quantification pipelines. 
- _minfi_: Preprocessin and analysis of Illumina methylation arrays
- _bumphunter_: Software for detectig differentially methylated regions (DMR)
-  _affy_: preprocessing methods for Affymetrix expression arrays, e.g. RMA
- _gcrma_: sequence based background correction for
- _frma_: frozen RMA and gene expression barcode 
- ymetrix expression arrays.
- _oligo_: preprocessing methods for general applications of arrays
- _crlmm_: genotype calling and copy number analysis for SNP arrays
- _affycomp_: engine software for affycomp website

### GitHub

Several of my projects, including this website, are developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/rafalab). This include


- [The code for DALS](https://github.com/genomicsclass)
- [bumphunter](https://github.com/rafalab/bumphunter)
- [THe code for my Data Science Class](https://github.com/datasciencelabs)
- [This webpage](https://github.com/rafalab/rafalab.github.io)
- [rafalib](https://github.com/rafalab/rafalib)



### Data Analysis for the Life Sciences (DALS) code

All the code used to create the figures, tables and results in the _Data Analysis for the Life Sciences_ [book](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) are hosted on GitHub and served off [this page](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/),




### rafalib

The _rafalib_ package contains sseries of shortcuts for routine tasks originally developed to facilitate data exploration. It is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rafalib/). The code is also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rafalab/rafalib).
